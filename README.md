# Des Moines Bike-Sharing Program Proposal

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use a set of visualizations to:
*Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
*Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
*Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
Interactive versions of all of the following graphics can be found at [this link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ray.chiang#!/vizhome/NYCCitibikeAnalysisChallenge/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis).

### Customer Breakdown Analysis
The majority of Citibike riders are subscribers, while the majority of customers are male.

### Checkout Time Analysis for Users and by Gender
For Checkout Times for Users, the 5th hour appears to be the peak point in the graph; The graph on gender shows Female and Male curves forming a similar shape, with the latter more steep due to being the majority of the riders. For Unknown, the number of rides seem roughly the same for every trip length.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
The most popular time appears to be approximately 5PM-7PM during the weekdays.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Once again, most of the customers are males and took trips mostly on weekdays.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
Males took more user trips as subscribers compared to the other genders.

## Summary
As shown by the graphs within the dashboard, a majority of the bikers are male, and the peak hours are during weekdays possibly on rush hour. One analysis would be to analyze the maintainence cost, while another would be to research bike routes to appeal to users.
